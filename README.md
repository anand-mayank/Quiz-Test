# Quiz-Test
## Quiz Test which embedded with Database.
## The Quiz test was done using a database exploited using Android studio 3.4 IDE and ADT.

# OVERVIEW
## Android is an open source and Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Android was developed by the open handset alliance, led by google and other companies.
Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need only develop for android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by android.
The first beta version of the android software development kit (SDK) was released by google in 2007 where as the first commercial version, android 1.0, was released in September 2008.
The source code for android is available under free and open source software licenses. Google publishes most of the code under the Apache License version 2.0 and the rest, Linux kernel changes, under the GNU General Public License version 2.
# ABSTRACT
Modern hand held devices such as smart phones have become increasingly powerful
in recent years. However, there are some applications that allow users to flexibly
execute tasks which are done by personal computer (PC), laptop etc. As mobile
devices become more like PCs they will come to replace objects to accomplish
necessary tasks. If any mobile applications has developed to mitigate administrative
work as well as fulfill user (other than administrator) requirement, then task can be
complete within the smart phone. Quiz application, which is developed for
Android base platform falls into this category.
The prime objective of “Quiz Application” is to take quiz for any individuals
For multiple subject at a time. Multiple choice questions (MCQ) will arrive for any interviewee for each quiz. All questions and answers must be
configure by an administrator and these administrative tasks including user creation
can be done from “Quiz Application”. Report will generate with score
where administrator can check for interviewee’s result. Or user can see the marks after getting the test.
# FEATURES OF ANDROID
Android is a powerful operating system competing with Apple 4GS and supports great features. Few of them are listed below: Feature
## Description
Beautiful UI
Android OS basic screen provides a beautiful and intuitive user interface.
## Connectivity
GSM/EDGE, IDEN, CDMA, EV-DO, UMTS, LTE, NFC, WiMAX, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.
## Storage
SOLite, a light weight relational database, is used for data storage purposes.
## Media support
H.263, H.264, MPEG-4 SP, AMR, AMR-WB, AAC, AAC 5.1, MP3, MID, WAV, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP.
## Messaging
SMS and MMS
## Web browser
Based on the open-source WebKit layout.
## Multi-touch
Android has native support for multi-touch which was initially made available in handsets such as the HTC Hero.
## Multi-tasking
User can jump form one task to another and same time various application can run simultaneously.
## Resizable widgets
Widgets are resizable, so users can expand them to show more content or shrink them to save space.
# ANDROID APPLICATIONS
Android applications are usually developed in the java language using the android software development kit. Once developed, android applications can be packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as google play store or the amazon Appstore. Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It’s the largest installed base of the mobile platform and growing fast. Every day more than 1 million new android devices are activated worldwide.
# TECHNOLOGY USED
## Front end:
• • XML:
Using Android’s XML vocabulary, you can quickly design UI layouts and the screen elements they contain, in the same way you create webpages in HTML with a series of nested elements.
Each layout file must contain exactly one root element, which must be a View or ViewGroup object. Once you have defined the root element, you can add additional layout objects or widgets as child elements to gradually build a view hierarchy that defines your layout.
## Back end:
• • Java development kit:
The Android build process depends on a number of tools from the JDK. Check out the build system overview documentation. The first big piece we need from JDK is javac- all your source code written in java needs to be complied before it can be converted to the DEX format.
Once your code has been complied, dexed, and packaged into an APK, we need jar signer to sign the APK.
# TOOLS USED
• • Eclipse w/ADT and Android Studio :
Although Eclipse is not the only java development environment that can be used to develop android applications, it is by far the most popular. This is partially due to its cost (free) but mostly due to the strong integration of the android tools with Eclipse. This integration is achieved with the Android Development Tools (ADT) plug-in for Eclipse, which can be downloaded from the android website.
• • The SDK and AVD Manager:
This tool serves a number of important functions. It manages the different versions of the android SDKs (build targets) that you can develop for, as well as third-party add-ons, tools, device drives, and documentation. Its second function is to manage the Android Virtual Device configurations (ADVs) you use to configure emulator instances.
• • Android Debug Bridge:
The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) connects other tools with the emulator and devices. Besides being critical for the other tools to function, you can use it yourself from the command line to upload and download files, install and uninstall packages, and access many other features via the shell on the device or emulator.
# INTRODUCTION TO APP
Our project is on Android Application name ‘OFFLINE QUIZ’.
The objective of this OFFLINE QUIZ android application is to provide a user to sign up in this application and to create a new user_id with password and then sign in to give the test.
After Sign_in there are multiple subject , user can select any of the subject as per the test and he/she can give the test only user have to select the correct answers out of 3-4 options .
After completing ,submit the answer and then go for next exam and at last user will get to know how much he/she give the correct answers in all the Quiz test.
Basically, this app is to take the different test in any of the field , admin can build the application as per the requirement.
This the best thing where we can save time , paper and efforts while taking any Quiz examination, It also save time.
Here some of the pictures that, how this application works:-
1- Home Page (While starting the application)
2- Sign Up Page
3- After successful Logged In.(In this page User see the result after test)
4-After selecting one subject:-
5-Selecting another subject
6-At last , Signing Out.
